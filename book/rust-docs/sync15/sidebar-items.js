The clients engine manages the client record for “this device, and also manages “commands”. In short, commands target one or more engines and instruct them to perform various operations - such as wiping all local data. These commands are used very rarely - currently the only command used in practice is for bookmarks to wipe all their data, which is sent when a desktop device restores all bookmarks from a backup. In this scenario, desktop will delete all local bookmarks then replace them with the backed up set, which without a “wipe” command would almost certainly cause other connected devices to “resurrect” the deleted bookmarks."],["engine","This module is used by crates which need to implement a “sync engine”.
